Instead of writing a single script, there are two scripts: one for Bob, and one for Alice.

For your bob script, your input will be of the form:

p
g
A
a

Alice's secret 'a' has been included because you will need it for your output. 
You will calculate c1 and c2. Use a random number generator for k, or you can select your own. 
You will define your own message for the variable 'm'. Your output should be a txt file of the form:

p
g
a
c1
c2
You will use this output as the input for your second script, where you will calculate Bob's message 'm'. 
For this script you may write to a final output.txt file, or you can just print the message.

Sample input: ElGamalInput.txt
